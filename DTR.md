Project: MASTERMIND
Group Member Names: Keegan O'Shea, Jennifer Brabson

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project? 
Our goals are to solidify understanding of how to work collaboratively on GitHub, the interaction between objects and an overall view.
More important than completion is for both team members to understand the project.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
To map out project: each of us would benefit from time to digest the requirements independently and then convene to map out next steps/overview.
Same can also apply to when developing new methods, class, etc.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Slack communication is most beneficial - holding all information in one central place. Phone numbers exhanged for OHMYGAWDIBROKEITINEEDHELPNOW moments.
* How would you describe your work style?
Keegan is a real adult and works well with structure and methodically. Jennifer is an animal and tries to do the same but is more of a
with the flow/changing schedules/whatever is best for the other person.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Jennifer finds it important to ensure others have understanding before moving on - complementing Keegan's ability to gain from project.
Keegan appreciates feedback and is not easily discouraged but rather open to instruction/learning/etc.
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Disregard for scheduled/agreed work times.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Direction can be set when mapping out project together; decisions on conflicting tasks can be evaluated for most efficiency and largest scope of readability.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
Table the issue and discuss possible solutions.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Good instruction - articulated/understood in a way that can be understood. Communication - open and updated when important.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Mornings are limited for Jennifer; black out times (flexible) 5-8:30pm MST. 
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Jennifer doesn't want to hurt feelings. Ever. So feedback is usually padded with a lot of words and compliments...
Keegan also operates this way. <-- Feedback is a gift. Because we care.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Jennifer's strength: Logic. While sometimes the code needed eludes me - the sense of logic is there, helping in pseudo code.
Keegan's strengths: Comfortable with pry environment to find solution.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
GitHub. Slack.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Communication; collaboration with others/Slack resources.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
If both people understand everything happening under the hood up to the point that it runs; meet the goals.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Real-time feedback. And cake.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
Preference for video off during long stretches; intense coding time.
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments? 
Address them as they arise with empathy for eachother.
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype. 
Locate closest public WiFi (coffee shops, for example) and message partner with update. Work on specified tasks as agreed upon, reconvene and compare once WiFi back on.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
As needed. We are a-dults.
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
Lead meetings with basic check in.
